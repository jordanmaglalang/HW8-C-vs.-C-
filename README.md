PURPOSE OF SOFTWARE:
This software was designed to perform the basic matrix operations of additon, multiplication, scalar multiplication and transpose implementation to solve D = A + (3*B)*C^T where A, B, and C are matrices. 

FILES: 

main.cpp: This C++ files demonstrates the matrix operations above to solve the equation using object-oriented programming where each object represents its own respective matrix.
main.c: This C file demonstrates the same matrix operations to solve the equation above, using library functions to implement the logic procedurally.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:

Requirements:

GCC (to compile C code using C99 standard)
G++ (to compile G++ code)
A terminal or command
